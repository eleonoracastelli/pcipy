# PCIpy

Principal Component Interferometry (PCI) package to process LISA data. 

This repo builds on the contents of [`pylisa`](https://github.com/qbaghi/pylisa), but structures the code using Python classes.

It implements the aPCI method outlined in the [first](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.042006) and [second](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.122001) PCI papers.
