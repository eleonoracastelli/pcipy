# Usage


The `pcipy` package performs PCI on a set of LISA simulated data.

In this repository, we provide:

- a few simple simulation scripts to generate simulated LISA data following the latest release of the LISA Simulation Suite
- a tutorial on how to use `pcipy` to obtain a PCI output from the simulated LISA data (not yet available)
- a notebook to explore single-link PCi filtering (not yet available)
- a tutorial on how to evaluate sensitivity curves (not yet available)
