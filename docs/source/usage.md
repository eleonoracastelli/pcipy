# Usage


The `pcipy` package performs PCI on a set of LISA simulated data.

In this repository, we provide:

- a few simple simulation scripts to generate simulated LISA data following the latest release of the LISA Simulation Suite
- a tutorial on how to use apply PCI to the simulated LISA data, explore single-link PCI filtering and evaluate sensitivity curves
